My Dream Hello! everyone.Do you have dreams? I your answers must be "yes".So do I. I have a dream of traveling around the world someday.I tnk one should not always stay in the same place,he should go out to other countries from time to time to see what is happening there and enjoy another kind of life.The outside world is so beautiful that I make up my mind to enjoy the amazing views of different places.First,I would like to go to Southeast Asia,such as Malaysia and Singapore.Second,I'll take my steps to Europe,including France and England.The Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Big Ban in London are my favorite places to visit.I can learn about the western culture and customs there. Then I'll travel to Australia to see animals,such as kangaroos.Australia is a developed country with beautiful scenery and fresh air. Africa is my next aim.The pyramids and wild animals are waiting for me to come.Now I am studying hard and preparing for my travel,I believe my dream will come true!Thank you.
