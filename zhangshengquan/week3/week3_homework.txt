1、给出任意一个列表，请查找出x元素是否在列表里面，如果存在返回1，不存在返回0

lst = ['hello','I','like','my','bicycle']

def my_retern(i):
    for word in lst:
        if word == i:
            return 1
        continue
    return 0

j = my_retern('bicycle1')
print(j)


2、任一个英文的纯文本文件，统计其中的单词出现的个数。
string = '''If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging  we will hold your hand and provide enough detail
for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics  properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web 
development on your own or as part of a class, a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, 
or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.'''

s=((string.replace(","," ")).replace(".","")).lower()
lst = s.split()
d={}
for c in lst:
    if not d.get(c):
        d[c]=1
        continue
    d[c] += 1
print(d)
